# Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Literature

This is a continuous initiative aimed at bringing together noteworthy initiatives in the domain of comprehending, interpreting, explaining, and visualizing a pre-trained ML model. 

State-of-the-art Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Machine Learning Models.

This page provides the infomation about the available state-of-the-art XAI tools comprehensive list. This list can be helpful to understand the available XAI techniques and which domains are using XAI. We need XAI for all the types of the Machine learning models, the scope of explanations can vary with the models and the domains applicability. XAI is a way to widley adopt the AI in the models  doamins. XAI is applicable to all the blackbox models which are not transparent to the users. Its is applicable in all domains including but not limited to 


üìù Natural Language Processing
üñºÔ∏è Computer Vision
üó£Ô∏è Audio
üêô Multimodal

# Types of XAI Technique
XAI Techniques are of different types.
* Ante-hoc/Post-hoc
* Model Specific/ Model Agnostic
* Surrogate
* Global/Local
