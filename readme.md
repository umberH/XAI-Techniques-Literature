# Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Literature

This is a continuous initiative aimed at bringing together noteworthy initiatives in the domain of comprehending, interpreting, explaining, and visualizing a pre-trained ML model. 

State-of-the-art Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Machine Learning Models.

This page provides the infomation about the available state-of-the-art XAI tools comprehensive list. This list can be helpful to understand the available XAI techniques and which domains are using XAI. We need XAI for all the types of the model including but not limited to Neural Network and Deep Neural Networ and for all doamins. XAI is applicable to all the blackbox models which are not transparent to the users. Its is applicable in all domains including but not limited to 


📝 Natural Language Processing
🖼️ Computer Vision
🗣️ Audio
🐙 Multimodal
